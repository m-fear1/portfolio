## About me

My name is Mark, and I am a computer science student. I am currently typing this with my eyes closed, as I am learning to touch type. My interest in coding started when I was about eleven, when my parents brought me to a scratch coding class in our local library, and I continued from there. I moved on from that and did another coding class in an afterschool class in a local school. There I learnt how to do Java via the application Processing 3. I went to that class for roughly 6 years, and from there I went to DCFE. From there I've learnt how to use even more coding languages, such as HTML, Python, CSS, Javascript, and, as of now, Markdown.








## Challenges

- When trying to add a link to a PDF of my CV, it wouldn't give me a link when trying to share the file, so I found a website I could upload PDFs to and put in a link to where it was uploaded there.

- I initially didn't know how to use Markdown to make a site, but now, after working with it for many days, I have got a better grasp of its components to use them to my full advantage.

- When I started using GitHub, I didn't know how to use it or how to set up a website, but after using it for many months, I have got better at using the site and making my portfolio.





## Feedback

- I had shown my website to my family, and they gave me different pieces of advice on how I could improve my site.

- When I had shown my site to my mother, she suggested that I use bullet points to spread out different sentences and to make what I'm saying clearer.

- When I had shown my site to my father, he said to me that he thinks I should include the coding languages that I know how to use so that if employers were looking at my page they can know right away what I'm proficient in.



## What I learnt

- I learnt how to effectively use Markdown to create websites.

- I learnt how to structure a portfolio that represents my skills as a programmer and computer science student.

- I learnt how to set up a GitHub account and how to download files from other accounts.

- I learnt how to create a "read me" page for my GitHub account.



## Areas I want to develop further

- I want to get even better at using different parts of Markdown (graphs, tables, etc)

- Have more projects to put on my portfolio.
