## About me
My name is Mark and I am a computer science student. I am currently typing this with my eyes closed, as I am learning to touch type. My interest in coding started when I was about eleven, when my parents brought me to a Scratch coding class in our local library, and I continued from there. I moved on from that and did another coding class in an afterschool class in a local school. There I learned how to do Java via the application Processing 3. I went to that class for roughly 6 years, and from there I went to DCFE. From there I've learned how to use even more coding languages, such as HTML, Python, CSS, Javascript, and, as of now, Markdown.

(This isn't my dog, but I needed to learn how to input images on Markdown)


## Challenges
- when trying to add a link to a PDF of my CV, it wouldn't give me a link when trying to share the file so I found a website i could upload PDFs to and put in a link to where it was uploaded there.
- I initally didn't know how to use Markdown to make a site but now after working with it for multiple days I have gotten a better grasp of it's components to use it to my full advantage
- When I started using Github I didn't know how to use it or how to set up a website, but after using it for multiple months, I have gotten better at using the site and making my portfolio.


## Feedback
- I had shown my website to my family and they gave me different pieces of advice on how i could improve my site.
- When I had shown my site to my mother, she suggested that I use bullet points to spread out different sentences and to make what I'm saying clearer.
- When I had shown my site to my father, he said to me that he thinks I should include the coding languages that I know how to use so that if employers were looking at my page they can know right away what I'm proficient in.

## What I learned
- I learned how to effectively use Markdown to create websites
- I learned how to structure a portfolio that represents my skills as a programmer and computer science student.
- I learned how to set up a GitHub account and how to download files from other accounts.
- I learned how to create a "read me" page for my GitHub account.
- 

## Areas I want to develop further
- I want to get even better at using different parts of Markdown (graphs, tables, etc)
- Have more projects to put on my portfolio.
