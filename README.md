## About me
My name is Mark and I am a computer science student. I am currently typing this with my eyes closed, as I am learning to touch type. My interest in coding started when I was about eleven, when my parents brought me to a Scratch coding class in our local library, and I continued from there. I moved on from that and did another coding class in an afterschool class in a local school. There I learned how to do Java via the application Processing 3. I went to that class for roughly 6 years, and from there I went to DCFE. From there I've learned how to use even more coding languages, such as HTML, Python, CSS, Javascript, and, as of now, Markdown. I enjoy coding as I see it as a challenge most of the time. If you have a goal in mind on what you want to create,  then as long as you have the right application open, the tools you need are there, all you have to do is figure it out and type it up.

(This isn't my dog, but I needed to learn how to input images on Markdown, and this picture showed up first when I searched dog so I went with it.) 


##challenges
- when trying to add a link to a PDF of my CV, it wouldn't give me a link when trying to share the file so I had to upload my CV to a PDF upload site and put in a link to where it was uploaded there.
- I initally didn't know how to use Markdown to make a site but now after working with it for multiple days I have gotten a better grasp of it's components to use it to my full advantage
